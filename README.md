# Lettuce Disease Detection

Welcome to the **Lettuce Disease Detection** repository! This project focuses on training Yolo11 model to accurately classify diseases affecting lettuce plants. Early detection and classification are crucial for preventing the spread of diseases and ensuring healthy crop yields.

## Project Overview
The Lettuce Disease Detection project is a part of our indoor farming project, aims to provide an automated solution for disease identification, helping in timely intervention and treatment.

## Getting Started
To run the training script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/lettuce-disease-detection.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use a virtual environment to manage them:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the training script**: Open the `train.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to start the training process.

## Results
The training process will generate logs and model checkpoints, which can be used to evaluate the model's performance and make further improvements.
